    "> Q1:- Explain the importance of functions\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ans:-Functions are fundamental in many areas of mathematics,\n",
    "> programming, and science. Here's a breakdown of their importance:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1\\. \\*\\*Modularity and Reusability\\*\\*:  \n",
    "> - In programming, functions allow you to encapsulate code into\n",
    "> reusable blocks. This makes your code cleaner, easier to manage, and\n",
    "> avoids duplication. For example, if you have a function to calculate\n",
    "> the area of a rectangle, you can use it wherever you need to perform\n",
    "> that calculation, without rewriting the logic each time.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2\\. \\*\\*Abstraction and Simplification\\*\\*:  \n",
    "> - Functions help abstract complex operations. You can use a function\n",
    "> to perform a complex series of steps and then interact with it using a\n",
    "> simple name. This makes it easier to understand and work with code or\n",
    "> mathematical expressions by breaking them into smaller, more\n",
    "> manageable parts.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3\\. \\*\\*Mathematical Relationships\\*\\*:  \n",
    "> - In mathematics, functions describe relationships between variables.\n",
    "> They allow us to model real-world phenomena and solve problems by\n",
    "> representing how one quantity changes with respect to another. For\n",
    "> example, the function \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) represents the relationship\n",
    "> where the output is the square of the input.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4\\. \\*\\*Problem Solving\\*\\*:  \n",
    "> - Functions are crucial for solving problems systematically. In\n",
    "> programming, breaking down a problem into smaller functions that each\n",
    "> handle a specific task can make it easier to solve complex issues. In\n",
    "> mathematics, functions provide a way to express and solve equations\n",
    "> and inequalities.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 5\\. \\*\\*Predictability and Control\\*\\*:  \n",
    "> - Functions ensure consistent behavior. Once a function is defined, it\n",
    "> will perform the same operation every time it is called with the same\n",
    "> inputs. This predictability is essential in both programming and\n",
    "> mathematical modeling.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Overall, functions are a powerful concept that underpins much of\n",
    "> modern computing and mathematical analysis. They enable us to\n",
    "> structure complex problems, enhance code efficiency, and maintain\n",
    "> clarity in both programming and mathematical contexts.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q 2:-Write a basic function to greet student\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Ans def greet_student(name):  \n",
    "> \"  \n",
    "> Function to greet a student with a personalized message.”\n",
    ">\n",
    "> \\# Example usage:  \n",
    "> student_name = \"Alice\"  \n",
    "> print(greet_student(student_name))\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q3:-Write a difference between print and return statements\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Ans :- **print Statement**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Purpose**: Outputs information to the console or standard output.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Usage**: Used for displaying information to the user or for\n",
    "> debugging purposes.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Effect**: Does not affect the value of expressions or the control\n",
    "> flow of the program\n",
    ">\n",
    "> beyond showing text.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Output**: Directly shows the result on the screen\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **return Statement**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Purpose**: Sends a value from a function back to the caller.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Usage**: Used to provide the result of a function so it can be\n",
    "> used elsewhere in the\n",
    ">\n",
    "> program.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Effect**: Terminates the function’s execution and optionally sends\n",
    "> back a value to the\n",
    ">\n",
    "> calling context.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Output**: Does not display the result directly but allows the\n",
    "> function to output a value\n",
    ">\n",
    "> that can be assigned to a variable or used in further calculations.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q4:- what are \\*args and \\*\\*kwargs?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Ans :**\\*args**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Purpose**: Allows a function to accept an arbitrary number of\n",
    "> positional arguments.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Syntax**: \\*args is used in a function definition preceded by an\n",
    "> asterisk.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **How It Works**: \\*args collects extra positional arguments as a\n",
    "> tuple. This means that\n",
    ">\n",
    "> any number of positional arguments passed to the function will be\n",
    "> stored in a tuple\n",
    ">\n",
    "> named args.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Usage**: Useful when you don't know beforehand how many arguments\n",
    "> will be passed\n",
    ">\n",
    "> to the function.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **\\*\\*kwargs**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Purpose**: Allows a function to accept an arbitrary number of\n",
    "> keyword arguments.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Syntax**: \\*\\*kwargs is used in a function definition preceded by\n",
    "> two asterisks.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **How It Works**: \\*\\*kwargs collects extra keyword arguments as a\n",
    "> dictionary. This\n",
    ">\n",
    "> means that any number of keyword arguments passed to the function will\n",
    "> be stored\n",
    ">\n",
    "> in a dictionary named kwargs, where the keys are argument names and\n",
    "> the values\n",
    ">\n",
    "> are the corresponding argument values.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Usage**: Useful when you want to accept named arguments that may\n",
    "> not be known in\n",
    ">\n",
    "> advance.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Q5:-explain the iterator function\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Ans: an iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through a\n",
    "> sequence of elements,\n",
    ">\n",
    "> such as items in a list or characters in a string, without needing to\n",
    "> know the underlying\n",
    ">\n",
    "> details of how the sequence is stored.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Example :-class NumberIterator:  \n",

    ">\n",
    "> Ans:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Polymorphism enhances code readability and reusability by allowing\n",
    "> methods to operate on objects of different classes in a consistent\n",
    "> way. By using a common interface (e.g., a method name like speak), you\n",
    "> can write more generic code that works with any subclass  \n",
    "> implementing that interface. This reduces the need for multiple\n",
    "> conditionals or type checks, making the code cleaner and easier to\n",
    "> understand. Additionally, it allows new classes to be added without\n",
    "> modifying existing code, fostering extensibility and reducing\n",
    "> maintenance efforts.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> Ans:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Python supports polymorphism through a concept known as *duck typing*.\n",
    "> Duck typing is a style of dynamic typing where the type or class of an\n",
    "> object is determined by its behavior (methods and properties) rather\n",
    "> than its explicit inheritance or class definition.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Duck Typing Explained**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In Python, duck typing is encapsulated by the adage: \"If it looks like\n",
    "> a duck and quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck.\" This means that\n",
    "> the type of an object is determined by whether it has the required\n",
    "> methods and properties, rather than whether it inherits from a\n",
    "> specific class.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> Ans:  \n",
    "> In Python, encapsulation is achieved by controlling access to an\n",
    "> object's internal state and implementation details. While Python does\n",
    "> not enforce strict access control like some other languages (e.g.,\n",
    "> private or protected keywords in Java), it provides mechanisms to\n",
    "> suggest and guide the intended use of an object's attributes and\n",
    "> methods. Encapsulation helps in\n",
    ">\n",
    "> hiding the internal workings of an object and exposing only what is\n",
    "> necessary, thereby promoting modularity and reducing the risk of\n",

    "> In Python, encapsulation can be bypassed due to the language’s\n",
    "> flexible and dynamic nature. While private and protected attributes\n",

    "> **1. Data Hiding**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Purpose**: Encapsulation hides the internal state and\n",
    "> implementation details of an object from the outside world. This means\n",
    "> that the internal workings of an object are protected from direct\n",
    "> access and modification.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Benefit**: By hiding the internal state, encapsulation ensures\n",

    "> helps in maintaining the integrity of the data and prevents unintended\n",
    "> or erroneous modifications.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **2. Controlled Access**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Purpose**: Encapsulation allows objects to control how their data\n",

    "> used.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Benefit**: Controlled access helps enforce business rules and data\n",

    ">\n",
    "> **5. Flexibility and Maintenance**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ● **Purpose**: Encapsulation provides flexibility by allowing the\n",

    "> ● **Purpose**: Encapsulation encourages the creation of reusable\n",

    ">\n",
    "> Provide an example showcasing encapsulation using property decorators.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Ans:  \n",
    "> Encapsulation in Python refers to the practice of bundling the data\n",
    "> (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a\n",
    "> single unit or class, and restricting direct access to some of the\n",
    "> object's components. This is often done to protect the internal state\n",
    "> of an object and to prevent unintended interference.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Property decorators (@property, @\\<propertyname\\>.setter, and  \n",
    "> @\\<propertyname\\>.deleter) are a key tool for implementing  \n",
    "> encapsulation in Python. They allow you to control access to an\n",
    "> attribute by defining methods that manage how the attribute is read,\n",
    "> written, or deleted. This provides a way to enforce validation,\n",
    "> maintain invariants, or compute values dynamically while still using a\n",
    "> clean and intuitive attribute-like syntax.\n",
